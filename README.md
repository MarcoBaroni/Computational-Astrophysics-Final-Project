# Computational-Astrophysics-Final-Project
Random Forest Classifier applyied to a dataset of simulated binary black holes.

Final project of Computational Astrophysics course in the master degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology at Padova University. Made with Carlo Rizza and Luca Beduzzi.

The pdf file is the final report of the work, the random forest named .ipynb files are the notebook on which we ran the two machine learning algorithms, stroopwafelinterface.py is the stroopwafel file.
